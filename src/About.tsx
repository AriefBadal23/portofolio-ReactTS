          Iâ€™m a second-year Computer Science student experienced in both team
          and individual projects. I specialize in backend development using C#,
          building secure WebAPIs, and ensuring efficient data flow to the
          frontend. I also work with Python, ReactJS, Docker, and PostgreSQL,
          and have a keen interest in cloud development and scalable
          applications. I strive to create secure, scalable, and maintainable
          solutions while continuously expanding my skills.
